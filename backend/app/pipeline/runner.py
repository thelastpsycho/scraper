"""Orchestrates the full data pipeline end-to-end in one background run:

  scrape PMS -> scrape CM -> combine inventory -> calculate yield ->
  verify data -> update Deluxe+Premiere allotment -> update BAR pricing

Each stage already exists as its own function (called individually today from
separate pages/buttons); this module calls them directly - not via their HTTP
routes - so it can own the whole run's progress stream and stop cleanly on
the first failure instead of continuing with stale/partial data.

Two of those stage functions (`scrape_cm_inventory`, `update_allotmet`,
`update_bar`) push their own progress messages onto the process-wide
`shared.log_queue` as a side effect of being called, regardless of caller.
`_log_forwarder` drains that queue for the duration of the run and republishes
each message onto `pipeline_queue`, tagged with whichever step is currently
running, so the pipeline can present one continuous, step-labeled stream
without those functions needing to change.
